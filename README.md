Collaborative Music Playlist Web App

This web application allows people to create, collaborate, and share music playlists. 

Anyone with access to a playlist ID has the ability to add songs to that playlist.

Currently, any youtube video can be added as music to a playlist.

Future functionality to be implemented:
    - SoundCloud integration
    - Authentication for restricting playlists to a certain group of people
    - Login and accounts
