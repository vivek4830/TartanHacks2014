    <p>Video is {{ duration }} seconds long, even if you can't see it.</p>

    <p>okso as you can see this whole page is generated just off of a youtube url. The title of the video and duration are all calculated on the fly. The video is (almost) invisible. See index@/songs/views.py for how it's done. Check out the git to see what I've changed.</p>
    <p>also, soundcloud has a python api. as in "pip install soundcloud". I read through it a bit, and I'm not sure how useful it is, but it doesn't seem too hard to get started. If you want to register our app and get full dev access it doesn't seem too hard. we just have to give an app name and website and it seems like they'll give us a "client id", which is important.</p>
